## SoundCores

The application is primarily developed to identify the sound type, it gets an audio as input and then detects and displays the type of sound and a brief definition of the sound it has detected. For an example when the user press the start button of the sound type recognition screen the sounds around him/her is detected from the application and is displayed on the screen
Eg: If the model detects a sound of someone crying, it will display “Crying ” along with a description “Crying is the dropping of tears (or welling of tears in the eyes) in response to an emotional state, or pain. Emotions that can lead to crying include sadness, anger, and even happiness.”
